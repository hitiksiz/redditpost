I rarely share personal thoughts, but I've carried this realization for a while now. It's not about anything
 dramatic happening; rather, it's about recognizing how much I've changed over the past year. Some days I
 miss my old self, while others I'm grateful for the transformation. I'm unsure about the right path forward,
 but I do know that staying stagnant isn't an option.
